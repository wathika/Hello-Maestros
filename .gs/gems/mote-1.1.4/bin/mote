MOTE(1)

NAME
       mote -- Minimum Operational Template

SYNOPSIS
       mote FILE [param1 value1 ... paramN valueN]

DESCRIPTION
       Use this command line tool to render mote templates. The result
       is redirected to standard output.

       The extra parameters supplied will be passed to the template.
       Note that all the parameter values will be treated as strings.

EXAMPLES
       If your template is called foo.mote, you can render it with the
       following command:

           mote foo.mote

       To write the result to a new file, just redirect the output:

           mote foo.mote > foo.html

      If the template uses a local variable `bar`, you can pass a
      value from the command line:

           mote foo.mote bar 42
